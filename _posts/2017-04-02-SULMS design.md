title: Alternative mass drivers for underwater launching missiles
---

Long ago, we started Aero -Propulsion with Piston type engines. Currently, we aware of piston type propulsion, turbine type propulsion, duct type propulsion, chemical propulsion, nuclear propulsion, solar propulsion, laser propulsion, and advanced electric propulsion. 

I am interested in advanced electric propulsion added with an essential flavour called â€œ**Lorentz Force**". **SULMS** means **Scaled Underwater Launching Missile System**. The proposed SULMS is based on travel of the missile in *underwater* and above the surface of water i.e., *through the atmosphere*.

**SULMS** are subdivided into two units. They are,

* Missile unit
* Armature unit

*Solid propellants* are used in the missile unit, as solid propellant can remain in storage for long periods, and then reliably launch on short notice; they have been frequently used in military applications such as missiles. *Capacitor bank* is used in the armature unit, since SULMS needs Lorentz force to propel the missile from underwater. 

A forecasting model of SULMS is shown you to imagine the entire system and its technical importance.

### Alternative mass drivers for underwater launching missiles

*Alternative mass driver - energy sources* for the evaluation of proposed research are,

* Mechanical energy
* Pneumatic energy
* Chemical energy
* Electromagnetic energy

Though the objective of the proposed research (SULMS) lies on the development of Electromagnetic launcher, it is better to do the comparison study, which will tell us the best suited alternative mass driver as well.


**Mechanical Energy source**

Spring or Piston can be the medium of mechanical energy. The stored energy of the spring or the displacement of piston can give energy to the missile for the acceleration of it to come over the water surface.

**Pneumatic Energy source**

Compressed air is being used for the acceleration of missile to come over the water surface.

**Chemical Energy source**

The chemical energy in the form of propellant is used for the acceleration of missile to come over the water surface.

**Electromagnetic energy source**

High current from the capacitor bank helps to generate Lorentz force perpendicular to the current direction forces the missile to come over the water surface.
