title: Understanding of Lorentz force in SULMS
---

I have posted this technical content to provide the fundamental thoughts of Electromagnetic force and its importance in the proposed research
**SULMS**. It also helps us to understand the operations involved in Rail-Armature concept. 

### ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE

A type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles is called as, "**Electromagnetic force**”. The electromagnetic
force can be produced by three types of fields known as the electro static field, magneto static field, and the electromagnetic field.

*Electrostatics* deals with the properties of stationary or slow-moving electric charges. Electrostatics involves the build-up of charge on the
surface of objects due to contact with other surfaces.

*Magneto statics* is the study of magnetic fields in systems where the currents are steady (not changing with time). It is the magnetic analogue of
electrostatics, where the charges are stationary. 

An **electromagnetic field** is a physical field produced by electrically charged objects.

The relation between the electric field E and the electric force FE on a point charge q is a simple one:  FE = q E. 

The relation between the magnetic field B and the magnetic force FB on a point charge q is more complicated:  FB = q (v×B) , where v is the velocity of the moving charge.
* The force is proportional to q.
* The force is proportional to B.
* The force is proportional to v.
* When B and v are parallel, the force vanishes.
* When B and v are not parallel, the force is perpendicular 	to both of them, according to the right-hand rule:

### The Lorentz force
We can combine FB and FE  into the Lorentz force FEM , which is the total electromagnetic force on a point charge q:
                                  
                                  FEM = q ( E + v × B )

FB-magnetic force; FE-electric force; FBM-electro magnetic force

*The capacitor bank* helps to generate Lorentz force perpendicular to the current direction forces the armature to come over the water surface in the proposed SULMS. 

**SULMS** is a system that uses electrical energy to propel a mass (Armature) by converting electrical energy into kinetic energy. Electromagnetic mass driver (SULMS) is used to accelerate an armature to extremely high velocities. A linear electromagnetic accelerator consisting of two rails and an armature in which the large amounts of current are passed through the rails to accelerate the armature by a Lorenz force. 

Rail-Armature does not require a long duration of power. In the proposed study, the charged capacitor bank is being used because of its instantaneous high current and high voltage supply. The characteristics of armature is that, to Choose a flat armature to increase surface contact and minimize electrical resistance, thus increasing the net current and the resulting Lorenz force, as well as decreasing heat production which might lead to the rails melting. The Lorentz force principle says that, the Lorentz force is perpendicular to the current direction. To avoid welding between armature and rail, the initial mass driver is needed. The initial mass driver (A small compressor unit) will avoid the welding of armature with the rail at the point of entry. This will result in the reduction of time of contact of the armature with the rails, at the entry point of conducting region of rails.
