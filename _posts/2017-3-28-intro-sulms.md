## A Way is begun for Underwater Launching Missile Technology

Long ago (in 11th century), gun powder and the fire arrow started rocket technology; On Feb. 15, 2017, PSLV-C37 launched 104 satellites into orbit on one single rocket. Origin from Fire arrow to satellite mission, we have come across lot of technology development. This technology development growth provided many ideas in aerospace propulsion. The following underwater launching missile technology is an added mission, can be used in Submarines, and in underwater defence missions.

In early days, Underwater Missile launch development started as the entire system (launch vessels) is required to be surfaced when they fired missiles. This research was started at the end of World War 2. In 1960, US, and Soviet Union succeeded in their underwater missile launching technology, capable being launched from underwater.

India has given much importance to the underwater missile technology. K-4 is a nuclear capable Intermediate-range submarine-launched ballistic missile under development by Defence Research and Development Organisation of India to arm the Arihant-class submarines. The missile has a reported effective range of over 3500 km.

## Existing system Vs Proposed research in Underwater Launching Missile technology

*Existing System*

* The torpedo tube (It is a tube in a submarine from which missiles are launched) is filled with a Missile, and the Missiles are launched by the use of compressed air from underwater to the water surface. 
* Compressors are fitted with torpedo tube, acts as a mass driver. It provides initial momentum to the missile to come over the water surface.
* A muzzle door (a sealed cap) is fitted on top of the torpedo tube, helps to avoid water flow inside the torpedo tube. Once missile is launched, muzzle door would be broken, provided initial momentum to the missile and allow missile to the water surface. 
* Once the missile comes across water surface, it will be powered by its own chemical energy. Then the missile is guided towards the targeted place.

*Proposed research*

* Torpedo tube is replaced with an Electromagnetic launcher. A power source (capacitor bank) is fitted with launcher as mass driver, generates Lorentz force to propel the missile from underwater to the water surface.
* An armature is placed inside the electromagnetic launcher. This armature contains the missile unit. Once the Lorentz force is generated, armature will come up to the water surface, then the armature separation activate the missile unit to propel by its own chemical energy. Then the missile is guided towards the targeted place.
* A muzzle door (a sealed cap) is fitted on top of the electromagnetic launcher, helps to avoid water flow inside the electromagnetic launcher. Once the armature is launched, muzzle door would be broken, provided initial momentum to the armature and allows the armature to the water surface.

### Tasks involved in the proposed research

The proposed research can be stated as, “SULMS –scaled underwater launching missile system”. SULMS is subdivided into two units.
* Missile unit
* Armature Unit

#### Missile Unit

Solid propellants are used in the missile unit, since solid propellant can remain in storage for long periods, and then reliably launch on short notice.

1.	Propellant making
2.	Propellant property test – Impulse test, rope test
3.	Missile casing design
4.	Centre of Gravity test, stability test
5.	Missile ignition, Altitude and Data recording test
6.	Parachute system design
7.	Overall missile unit optimization test
8.	Missile-Armature separation test

#### Armature Unit

Capacitor bank is used in the armature unit; the armature is propelled by the Lorentz force.

1.	Capacitor bank charger making
2.	Capacitor bank design
3.	Rail-Armature construction (Electromagnetic launcher design)
4.	Underwater environment making (water tank construction)
5.	Initial mass driver design
6.	Armature velocity test 
7.	Armature separation test

## Objective of SULMS

1.	To utilize electrical energy as mass driver, construct an electromagnetic launcher.
2.	To provide a propelling source for missile, make an efficient solid propellant.
3.	Armature control system has to be designed to separate missile from armature effectively.
4.	Underwater environment is to be created, and test the electromagnetic launcher’s performance by varying the water depth, supply power, armature mass.

Ultimately, the purpose of SULMS is all about on travel of the missile in underwater and above the surface of water i.e., through the atmosphere.
