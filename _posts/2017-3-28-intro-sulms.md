title: Introduction of SULMS
---
**SULMS** means **Scaled Underwater Launched Missile System**. Aerospace pilots (Masters) are looking for *Advanced Propulsion* concepts, mainly in **Electric Propulsion**. I am interested in the same electric propulsion added with a essential flavour called "**Lorentz Force**. 
The SULMS system is based on travel of the missile in underwater and above the surface of water i.e., through the atmosphere. The Electromagnetic launching system generates Lorentz force to accelerate the missile through the water. Once the missile surfaces above water, it will be powered by its own chemical energy.

SULMS integrates the following systems.

1. Missile 
2. Armature

In SULMS, **Missile** is powered by Solid Propellant, and **Armature** is powered by Lorentz (Electromagnetic) force.
*Lorentz force* can be explained pictorially from the following figure.
