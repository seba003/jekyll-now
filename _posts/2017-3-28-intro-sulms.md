title: Introduction of SULMS
---
  Long ago, we started Aero -Propulsion with Piston type engines. Currently, we aware of turbine type propulsion, duct type propulsion, chemical propulsion, nuclear propulsion, solar propulsion, laser propulsion, and advanced electric propulsion. 

  I am very much interested in the electric propulsion added with an essential flavour called â€œLorentz Force". The next generation's aero-pilots (masters) will be using Alternative energy sources as propulsion resource.
 
 **SULMS** means **Scaled Underwater Launching Missile System**. The proposed SULMS system is based on travel of the missile in underwater and above the surface of water i.e., through the atmosphere. 

The scope of my project is all about the experimentatal investigation of underwater launching missile technology. A ballistic missile capable of being launched from underwater is proposed here as **SULMS**.  See more about [submarine missiles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine-launched_ballistic_missile)

The entire system is subdivided into two units. These are,

* Chemical Propulsion unit
* Electric Propulsion unit

Solid propellants are used in the chemical propulsion unit, since solid propellant can remain in storage for long periods, and then reliably launch on short notice, they have been frequently used in military applications such as missiles. Capacitor bank is used in the electric propulsion unit, since SULMS needs electromagnetic force to propel the missile from underwater. 

The forecasting model of SULMS is shown in the below figure.

SULMS prototype is capable of being launched from underwater from a depth of 2-3 metres. The armature can be installed in a electromagnetic launcher vertically in the SULMS. The SULMS has unique configuration similar to the submarine missile launching system.
