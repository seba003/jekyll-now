I would like to share my experiences in SULMS study.

### SUBMARINE LAUNCHED MISSILE TECHNOLOGY

It can be understood from the title itself that, a ballistic missile capable of being launched from submarines. The first practical design of a submarine-based launch platform was developed by the Germans near the end of World War II. It involves a launch tube which is having a V-2 ballistic missile variant towed behind a submarine. The early SLBM systems required vessels to be surfaced when they fired missiles.

The following lists are the SLBM (Submarine launched ballistic missile) development in India:

1.	K-15 Sagarika (750-1,900 km) -Operational on the Arihant class submarine.
2.	K-4 (3,500 km) Test fired from Arihant class submarine. 
3.	K-5 (6,000 km) – Under development

From the above figure, it is noted that, missiles have to be launched from submarine by a mass driver. It may be hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical or any other energy sources as mass driver. It implies that, the efficient mass driver needed for the better performance. The conventional mass drivers for SLBM are Torpedo tube.

### Torpedo Tube

It is a tube in a submarine from which missiles are launched by the use of compressed air or an explosive charge. It is a cylindrical shaped device, and it is a more complex mechanism than a torpedo tube on a surface ship. Because the tube has to accomplish the function of moving missile from the normal atmospheric pressure within the submarine into the sea at the ambient pressure of the water around the submarine. Thus a submarine torpedo tube operates on the principle of an airlock. See more about [torpedo tube.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_tube) Early French submarines use pistons to push the missiles outside the tube, instead of blowing it out with compressed air. 

We can use many alternative energy sources in the torpedo tube. The possible alternative energy sources are,

* Mechanical energy (Piston/spring)
* Pneumatic energy/hydraulic energy
* Chemical energy
* Electromagnetic energy

### Electromagnetic energy source

The high current, high voltage from the capacitor bank helps to generate Lorentz force perpendicular to the current direction forces the missile to come over the water surface. The following figure represents the experimental setup of making Lorentz force.

## Missile Unit

As i discussed in my first post, the following contents will describe the missile unit in the SULMS system.

**SOLID PROPELLANT PREPARATION AND TESTS**

In this topic, the knowledge of solid propellant motor is discussed. A small scaled solid propellant missile was fabricated and the tests were carried out.

*SOLID PROPELLANT MISSILES*

Solid propellant can remain in storage for long periods, and then reliably launch on short notice, they have been frequently used in military applications such as missiles.
The following figure represents that, A simple solid propellant motor consists of a casing, nozzle, grain (propellant charge), and igniter. The grain behaves like a solid mass, burning in a predictable fashion and producing exhaust gases. The nozzle dimensions are calculated to maintain a design chamber pressure, while producing thrust from the exhaust gases. Once ignited, a simple solid propellant motor cannot be shut off, because it contains all the ingredients necessary for combustion within the chamber in which they are burned.

A home made solid propellant is fabricated, and tested. The properties of solid propellants are, 

* Chemical reaction between the fuel and oxidizer must release large amount of heat energy giving higher combustion temperature and specific impulse. 
* The propellant must have comparatively lower molecular weight; higher density and should give high specific impulse.
* The products of combustion, i.e., Exhaust gas should be smokeless and colourless.
* The propellants should be chemically inert. It should not ignite due to slight impact or shock or pressure. 
* Raw material must be abundantly available; must be cheap, safe to handle.
* Must be easy and safe to grind, mix, heat, trim, pack, and store the propellants. Also it should be practicable to cast or extrude the solid propellants in desired shape and sizes.
* It should be stable. The physical and chemical properties should not change during processing; should not deteriorate with time.

**Propellant preparation**

There are 4 types of solid propellant preparation techniques are available. These are,

1.	Dry ramming
2.	Melting/Casting –most commonly used method
3.	Moist pressing
4.	Recrystallization

Recrystallization method is used here for safe and easy operation. The advantages of recrystallization method are,

* Operator is not exposed to hot propellant during the cooking process.
* No need to grind or mill the components
* Stores well when properly sealed.
* Can be reheated and formed into grains days/months or years after preparation.
* It is somewhat less brittle than melt/ cast propellants
* Burn rate can be adjusted somewhat by the extent of “cooking”.
* It produces very little waste, compared to casting method.

### Electric Igniters for propellant ignition

  Radio frequency transmitter and receiver (433MHz) are used to control the ignition. A 5 volt DC relay circuit used to synchronize the signal and ignition performance. When the ignition is needed, transmitter provides signal to the receiver. The receiver unit will control the 5VDC relay. The electric ignitor is short circuited by a copper wire, so due to the heat generated on the wire, the ignition started.

### TOTAL IMPULSE MEASURING SYSTEM

  The solid propellant motor, when fired, produces a thrust force. A sensitive weighing machine calibrated the force in terms of grams, proportional to the thrust force. Also we can see the ignition flow pattern of the the exhaust gases, exit flow temperatures, and burnout time. This impulse measuring system is used to find the propellant properties.

### Experimental Calculation

Here are the formulae for finding the specific impulse, and mass flow rate, etc.

* Total Impulse = (Thrust*Burning time)
* Specific Impulse = (Total Impulse/ Total burning propellant weight)
* Mass flow rate = (Propellant mass/ Rocket Operation Duration)
* Thrust = (Specific impulse*Gravity*mass flow rate)
* Effective Exhaust velocity = (specific impulse* Gravity) 

### ROPE TEST

Rope test has been done as shown in figure to study the velocity and impact behaviour of the solid propellant motor. 45deg angle of inclination made to the rope of 100m distance. The two ends of the rope were tied and the propellant motor allowed to slide on the rope as shown in the figure.

## ELECTROMAGNETIC LAUNCHING SYSTEM

**Lorentz force**

The high current, high voltage from the capacitor bank helps to generate Lorentz force perpendicular to the current direction which forces the missile to come over the water surface. The following figure represent practical model of the rail gun launcher.

<img src= "/images/sulms/rail gun model.jpg" width= "400px">

The Lorentz force is created as a result of current flow through the armature which interacts with the magnetic field produced by the parallel gun rails. A charger unit is used to charge the capacitor bank. The initial mass driver (small compressor) is connected with the rail gun model to provide initial momentum and to avoid self-weld fusion of the projectile with the rails. The capacitor bank is separated from the charging unit and Capacitor bank is now connected with the rail gun launcher. 

17 capacitors were connected in parallel, which had a capacitance of 470 µF, 220V DC.
The electrical energy stored in the capacitor is potential energy. Capacitor’s potential energy is equal to the projectile’s kinetic energy. “All of the P.E. from the capacitors is converted into K.E.

An attempt is made to study **Electromagnetic force** experimentally.
